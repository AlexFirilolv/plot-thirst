## Design Principles

### 1. Dark & Intimate
- Predominantly dark backgrounds create a private, intimate atmosphere
- Like reading by candlelight or in a dimly lit bedroom
- Reduces harsh brightness, encouraging longer reading sessions

### 2. Sophisticated Sensuality
- Avoid crude or garish design
- Elegance and taste are paramount
- Sensual without being explicit in the UI itself
- Think high-end boutique, not adult store

### 3. Contrast & Tension
- High contrast between text and background for readability
- Visual tension through color pairing (red against green, light against dark)
- Mirrors the tension in erotic storytelling

### 4. Minimalism with Purpose
- Clean layouts that don't distract from content
- Every element serves a purpose
- White space (or rather, dark space) is generous
- Focus on the stories, not the chrome

### 5. Subtle Luxury
- Refined details: smooth gradients, soft shadows, elegant borders
- Premium feel without being ostentatious
- Quality over quantity in visual elements

## Spacing & Layout

## Accessibility

- Provide focus indicators (red outline/glow)
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion
- Semantic HTML throughout
- ARIA labels for icon-only buttons
